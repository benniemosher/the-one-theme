# The One Theme

> A dark theme for [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/) based on [Atom's](http://atom.io/) One Dark syntax theme.

## Roadmap

###### "Are you going to create a light color scheme?"

Yes. [Atom](http://atom.io/) has a One Light syntax theme, and eventually we will support that theme as well.

###### "Are you going to support editor X?"

I hope so, but I need your help to accomplish that. Since you're using editor X you're probably much more expert on it than me. So feel free to send a pull request based on the [Color Palette](#color-palette) below.
